Kontainer Engine Example Driver
===============================

This is the Kontainer-Engine Example Driver.  The purpose of this repo is to 
show how to write a custom Cluster Driver for rancher.  At a minimum to write 
a custom Cluster Driver for Rancher you will need to do the following: 

1. Implement the Driver interface
2. Write a `main` func that will accept a port argument and start a GRPC 
server on the supplied port
3. Package your driver and distribute it in a way that rancher can consume

We will go over each of these steps in detail.

### Implementing the driver interface
The Driver interface you will need to implement is as follows:
```go
type Driver interface {
	GetDriverCreateOptions(ctx context.Context) (*DriverFlags, error)
	GetDriverUpdateOptions(ctx context.Context) (*DriverFlags, error)

	Create(ctx context.Context, opts *DriverOptions, clusterInfo *ClusterInfo) (*ClusterInfo, error)
	Update(ctx context.Context, clusterInfo *ClusterInfo, opts *DriverOptions) (*ClusterInfo, error)
	PostCheck(ctx context.Context, clusterInfo *ClusterInfo) (*ClusterInfo, error)
	Remove(ctx context.Context, clusterInfo *ClusterInfo) error

	GetVersion(ctx context.Context, clusterInfo *ClusterInfo) (*KubernetesVersion, error)
	SetVersion(ctx context.Context, clusterInfo *ClusterInfo, version *KubernetesVersion) error
	GetClusterSize(ctx context.Context, clusterInfo *ClusterInfo) (*NodeCount, error)
	SetClusterSize(ctx context.Context, clusterInfo *ClusterInfo, count *NodeCount) error

	GetCapabilities(ctx context.Context) (*Capabilities, error)

	RemoveLegacyServiceAccount(ctx context.Context, clusterInfo *ClusterInfo) error

	ETCDSave(ctx context.Context, clusterInfo *ClusterInfo, opts *DriverOptions, snapshotName string) error
	ETCDRestore(ctx context.Context, clusterInfo *ClusterInfo, opts *DriverOptions, snapshotName string) error
	GetK8SCapabilities(ctx context.Context, opts *DriverOptions) (*K8SCapabilities, error)
}
```
#### GetDriverCreateOptions
This func supplies the flags necessary to build the API schema in Rancher for 
the Cluster Driver. It also provides the arguments for the kontainer-engine 
CLI. Here is an example flag from the GKE driver `GetDriverCreateOptions` func:    

```go
	driverFlag.Options["disk-size-gb"] = &types.Flag{
		Type:  types.IntType,
		Usage: "Size of the disk attached to each node",
		Default: &types.Default{
			DefaultInt: 100,
		},
	}
```

After being parsed by Rancher this field will be turned into the resource field on the schema:
```json
"diskSizeGb": {
    "create": true,
    "default": 100,
    "description": "Size of the disk attached to each node",
    "dynamicField": true,
    "type": "int",
    "update": true
},
```

Note that the name of the field was transformed from kebab case to camel case 
before the schema was generated.

#### GetDriverUpdateOptions
This func provides the arguments when the driver is used in the kontainer-
engine CLI.  It is not used to populate the Rancher API schema.

#### Create
This func creates the cluster in the managed Kubernetes provider and populates 
sufficient information on the `ClusterInfo` return value so that `PostCheck` 
can connect to the cluster. See the `PostCheck` description for more info on 
this process.

#### Update
This func updates the cluster in the managed Kubernetes.  Like `Create` it 
must ensure `ClusterInfo` is populated with sufficient information for 
`PostCheck` to generate a service account token.  If no connection information 
has changed, then it can be left alone and it will reuse the information 
generated by `Create`.

#### PostCheck
This func must populate the `ClusterInfo.serviceAccountToken` field with a 
service account token with sufficient permissions for Rancher to manage the 
cluster. We recommend using the utilities 
(`util.GenerateServiceAccountToken(clientset)`) provided in kontainer-engine 
to generate this token.  Note that the `GenerateServiceAccountToken` func 
requires a `kubernetes.Interface` be passed into it. This means that the 
`Create` and `Update` functions MUST populate sufficient information on the
`ClusterInfo` metadata in order for a connection to be established.  See this 
example from GKE driver: 
```go
	bytes, err := json.Marshal(state)
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}
	if info.Metadata == nil {
		info.Metadata = map[string]string{}
	}
	info.Metadata["state"] = string(bytes)
```
The `state` struct is marshalled to json and then stored on the 
`Metadata["state"]` field.
```go
func (d *Driver) PostCheck(ctx context.Context, info *types.ClusterInfo) (*types.ClusterInfo, error) {
	state, err := getState(info)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}
	
	...
	
func getState(info *types.ClusterInfo) (state, error) {
	state := state{}
	// ignore error
	err := json.Unmarshal([]byte(info.Metadata["state"]), &state)
	return state, err
}
```
Then `PostCheck` calls `getState`, passing in the `info` variable, where the 
previously marshalled `state` object is unmarshalled into a new state 
instance.  This information is later used to construct the 
`kubernetes.Interface` to communicate with the cluster and generate the 
service account token.    
  
#### Remove
This func must remove the cluster from the cloud provider.  Like `PostCheck` 
it will receive the `clusterInfo` populated from `Create` or `Update` and must 
make delete the cluster with that information.

#### GetVersion

This returns the current Kubernetes version in the cluster.  Currently unused 
in Rancher.  It is not necessary to implement this func (see `Note` below).
  
#### SetVersion
Sets the Kubernetes version in the cluster. Currently unused in Rancher.  It 
is not necessary to implement this func (see `Note` below).
                                            
#### GetClusterSize
Gets the current number of nodes in the cluster. Currently unused in Rancher. 
It is not necessary to implement this func (see `Note` below).

#### SetClusterSize
Sets the current number of nodes in the cluster. Currently unused in Rancher. 
It is not necessary to implement this func (see `Note` below). 

#### GetCapabilities
Returns the state of various optional funcs on the driver.

#### RemoveLegacyServiceAccount
This func does not need to be implemented by drivers it is used for internal 
backwards compatibility with the built in Cluster Drivers. Simply return `nil` 
for all arguments.    

#### ETCDSave
Saves the current ETCD state. Cloud provider dependent. It is not necessary to 
implement this func (see `Note` below). If unimplemented this func should 
return an error message.  

#### ETCDRestore
Restores the previous ETCD state. Cloud provider dependent. It is not 
necessary to implement this func (see `Note` below). If unimplemented this 
func should return an error message. 

#### GetK8SCapabilities
Returns the capabilities of the Kubernetes cluster.  See the struct definition 
in Rancher/Types for a full description of all fields.

Note: for some operations it is not necessary 
to implement them to ensure proper functioning of your driver with Rancher. 
Simply return nil for all return arguments if you do not wish to implement 
them.  You can also embed the structs `UnimplementedVersionAccess` and 
`UnimplementedClusterSizeAccess` as appropriate.

The following funcs do not need to be implemented:
- GetVersion 
- SetVersion 
- GetClusterSize 
- SetClusterSize 
- ETCDSave*
- ETCDRestore* 

_*These funcs should return an error instead of nil if they are unimplemented._

### Main Func
The main func in your binary needs to do the following things:

1. Accept a positional argument of an integer (the port)
2. Use this port argument to start a GRPC server on localhost at the specified port

Point 1 is as simple as accepting parsing the first positional argument as a 
integer (see [main.go](./main.go) for an example). For point 2, we recommend using 
the GRPC servers provided in the kontainer-engine github 
[repo](https://github.com/rancher/kontainer-engine). These can be invoked as follows:
```go
go types.NewServer(&Driver{}, addr).ServeOrDie(fmt.Sprintf("127.0.0.1:%v", port))
```
Note that the `Driver{}` struct is our custom Cluster Driver and the `port` 
is the positional argument we received in our main func. 


### Packaging and distributing


## Building

`make`

Will output driver binaries into the `dist` directory, these can be imported 
directly into Rancher and used as cluster drivers.  They must be distributed 
via URLs that your Rancher instance can establish a connection to and download 
the driver binaries.  For example, this driver is distributed via a GitHub 
release and can be downloaded from one of those URLs directly.


## Running

Go to the `Cluster Drivers` management screen in Rancher and click 
`Add Cluster Driver`. Enter the URL of your driver, a UI URL (see the UI 
[skel repo](https://github.com/rancher/ui-cluster-driver-skel) for details), and a 
checksum (optional), and click `Create`. Rancher will automatically download 
and install your driver. It will then become available to use on the 
`Add Cluster` screen.
